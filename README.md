# Projeto Mestrado Rodrigo Perim

## Carregando Pacotes

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ncdf4)
library(geobr)
```

## Ler um arquivo de dados `.NC`

``` r
# Buscar os nomes dos arquivo .nc4
list_nc4 <- list.files("data-raw/",
           recursive = TRUE,full.names = TRUE,pattern = ".nc4")

# Abrindo o1 arquivo
nc_obj <- nc_open(list_nc4[1])
#> [1] ">>>> WARNING <<<  attribute missing_value is an 8-byte value, but R"
#> [1] "does not support this data type. I am returning a double precision"
#> [1] "floating point, but you must be aware that this could lose precision!"

# buscando os nomes dos atributos no arquivo
# names(nc_obj[['var']])
```

## Função para ler um arquivo e extrair colunas de interesse

``` r
## função para ler arquivos NCD4
ncdf_reader <- function(file_path){
  nc_file <- ncdf4::nc_open(file_path)
  df <- data.frame(
    "longitude"=ncdf4::ncvar_get(nc_file,varid="longitude"),
    "latitude"=ncdf4::ncvar_get(nc_file,varid="latitude"),
    "time"=ncdf4::ncvar_get(nc_file,varid="time"),
    "xco2"=ncdf4::ncvar_get(nc_file,varid="xco2"),
    "xco2_quality_flag"=ncdf4::ncvar_get(nc_file,varid="xco2_quality_flag"),
    "xco2_incerteza"=ncdf4::ncvar_get(nc_file,varid="xco2_uncertainty"),
    "fs"=ncdf4::ncvar_get(nc_file,varid="Retrieval/fs"),
    "fs_rel"=ncdf4::ncvar_get(nc_file,varid="Retrieval/fs_rel"),
    "path" = file_path
  )
  ncdf4::nc_close(nc_file)
  return(df)
}
```

## Vamos ler todos os arquivos na pasta

## Retirando 500 obs do banco de dados e plotando

``` r
data_set |> 
  sample_n(500) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=longitude, y=latitude)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Então vamos plotar dentro do mapa do Brasil

``` r
## Pegando o contorno do BR
br <- read_country(showProgress = FALSE)
```

fazer o plot do BR

``` r
br |>
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::geom_sf(fill="white", color="#FEBF57",
                   size=.15, show.legend = FALSE)
